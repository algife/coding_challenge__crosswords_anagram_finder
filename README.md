# Crosswords Anagram Finder Live Coding Challenge

## Summary

> The main purpose of this challenge is to make use of the code base provided to create a crossword finder where the user can introduce a word or multiple words in an input field and the finder will find the anagrams that can be made with those words using as a reference a dictionary plenty of words that needs to be retrieved from an external text file published online. We need to bear in mind efficiency. The main purpose is to do a live coding challenge sharing thoughts loud when developing the solution.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Next steps

If this was a real case scenario, After the main functionality is built I would have worked to improve the User Experience and User Interface to make It look nicer using Material Design components as List, and Form Inputs
